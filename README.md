# Terminal-Chatbot
A simple chatbot

This code implements a simple chatbot in Python that responds to user inputs based on predefined categories such as greetings, time, date, technology, programming, jokes, origin, fun facts, and movies. If the chatbot doesn't recognize the input, it asks the user to try again.
